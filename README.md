# E-Technician – Software Architecture Design Project

E-Technician is a software engineering course project that presents the **architecture and system design** of a digital platform that connects clients with local technicians.  
The project focuses on **software architecture, system modeling, requirements engineering, and design documentation**, rather than full implementation.

---

## 📌 Project Idea

E-Technician aims to simplify how clients find and communicate with skilled technicians such as locksmiths, electricians, and maintenance providers.

Clients can:
- Submit service requests with descriptions, images, or videos
- Receive multiple offers from nearby technicians
- Compare cost, time, and ratings
- Choose the best technician easily and securely

Technicians can:
- Register and verify their skills
- Receive service requests in their area
- Send cost and time estimates
- Communicate with clients and receive payments after job completion

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design a user-friendly platform for clients and technicians
- Reduce the time required to find suitable service providers
- Apply proper **software architecture principles**
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Demonstrate system modeling using standard UML diagrams
- Follow an Agile software development methodology

---

## 👥 Target Audience

- Individual consumers
- Small businesses
- Property managers
- Local service providers (technicians)

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architectural pattern:

- **View Layer**  
  User interfaces for clients and technicians (mobile application).

- **Controller Layer**  
  Handles user requests, business logic, and system coordination.

- **Model Layer**  
  Manages data storage, retrieval, and interaction with the database.

---

## 🧩 Key System Components

- User authentication and login system
- Profile management for clients and technicians
- Media upload system (images/videos)
- Location-based matching system
- Secure chat and communication system
- Online payment and invoicing system
- Rating and review system

---

## 🛠️ Functional Requirements

- Support a large number of users and service requests
- Allow clients to publish service offers with media
- Notify technicians based on location
- Enable secure messaging between users
- Provide online payment and confirmation flow
- Allow rating and review after service completion

---

## ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

- High availability and responsiveness
- Data privacy and security
- Secure payment processing
- Scalability and maintainability
- Easy future system upgrades without disruption

---

## 🧪 Technologies (Design-Level)

- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Payments:** Bank APIs
- **Security:** HTTPS, SSL/TLS
- **Testing Tools:** Jest, Detox

---

## 🔄 Software Development Methodology

The project follows the **Agile methodology**, emphasizing:
